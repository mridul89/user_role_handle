User Role Layout Handle
=======================

A very basic magento module that adds the ability for admin side theme developers to change the blocks output according to user role.
This module adds a new handle in the form of `admin_user_role_{RoleName}` to the layout updates xml to allow for custom updates.
This may have many applications such as showing different data on the dashboard depending on the user role
